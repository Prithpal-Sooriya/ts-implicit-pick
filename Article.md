# Creating a type safe implicit Pick

This article discusses the implementation of an implicit pick, the reason for it & what makes it special.

Here is a Typescript Playground with examples that will be used as a reference.

```ts
//#region Setup - Example Interface and consuming function.
interface Product {
  id: string;
  price: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  author: string;
  date: Date;
  category: string...
```

## Why an implicit Pick? Why not Partial?

Partial is great if you want to create an object with some of the values from a given interface. However when the object is used (via property access or through some consuming type), the object still is a `Partial` - as in all properties are optional, even if you have provided a value.
![Example of Partial](./images/PartialExample.png)

In these cases, what we really want is a `Pick`ed object - an object with the properties we want "picked" out of the original interface.

## The Verbosity of Pick

Pick is perfect, it gives us the exact strict type that we want, however (as shown) it is very verbose.
![Example of Pick](./images/PickExample.png)
For each prop we want, we need to write it for the `type` as well as for the object.
For small objects, this might not be much of an issue - however this can become very large the more props we want.

So now lets design an implicit pick!

## 1st Implicit Pick - okay, but no IntelliSense ðŸ˜¢

Here is the design of the initial implicit Pick.

```ts
const buildImplicitPickVer1 =
  <T>() =>
  <K extends keyof T>(props: Pick<T, K>): Pick<T, K> =>
    props;

// Usage
const pickProduct = buildImplicitPickVer1<Product>();
const implicitProduct = pickProduct({ id: '1', ... })
```

Breakdown:

- `<T>() =>`
  - The is a factory function part that allows you to build a pick on whatever type you provide it.
- `<K extends keyof T>`
  - We have a generic type `K` that is constrained to the type given in the factory.
- `(props: Pick<T, K>): Pick<T, K>`
  - this parameter gets inferred as the developer types in the keys of their object.
  - Invalid keys will spit out an error (since does not match the Generic type)
  - Invalid values for the key will spit errors, since it won't match the `Pick`ed object values.

This is exactly what we want - a type-safe implicit pick! Refactored changes (renaming/removing) on the interface will propagate through to the objects too!

Well... after some usage I found that it didn't really give a good Developer Experience (DX).

IntelliSense/auto-complete (via `CTRL + SPACE`) doesn't give us any useful information on what props we can use.
![Implicit Pick with no IntelliSense](./images/ImplicitPickNoAutoComplete.png)

Only once we start typing do we get errors if a key does not match the interface, we aren't able to get a list of all keys that we can use.

This is because our parameter type in our factory function `Pick<T, K>` relies on keys given. Lets fix that!

## Implicit Pick with the best Dev Experience!

Here is the the solution to the bad DX version above:

```ts
const buildImplicitPick =
  <T>() =>
  <K extends keyof T>(props: Partial<T> & Pick<T, K>): Pick<T, K> =>
    props;
```

The small change that made the huge difference is the intersection type `Partial<T> & Pick<T, K>`

- The `Partial<T>` give us the ability to get back our auto complete for keys.
- Intersecting is with the Pick `& Pick<T, K>` ensures that we get the correct type for our key.

Intersection above means that we take only the props/types that match in both types given.

```
type A = { a: number | undefined }
type B = { a: number }
type C = A & B; // will be { a: number } since that is what both types above have.
```

Whats awesome is that we can see the IntelliSense working in real time!
When we `CTRL + SPACE` to see what props are available, they are all optional because of the `Partial`.

But as soon as we select a property to use, it becomes required:

- because the Generic `K` keys are updated;
- subsequently so is the `Pick<T, K>`
- and finally the intersection `Partial<T> & Pick<T, K>` enforces are type to be required.

## Conclusion

Above shows how to write a type-safe, refactor-safe implicit Pick function with useful IntelliSense information.

The function itself is rather simple, but the main takeaway for me is to try/test out different type implementations to provide better IntelliSense information & better developer experience (DX).
